# Request

Before a Plan gets created, it first must be approved to ensure it is a valid plan from AssureX.

To achieve this, the client will called the Request method, which will return an array of valid options
(ie. how many installments the client chooses to pay back in, with varying interest rates).

```ts filename="Request Object" {/* {1-3} */} copy
type Request = {
  email: string
}
```

```ts filename="Response Object" {/* {1-3} */} copy
type Response = {
  email: string
  date: string
  principal: number
  base: number
  interest: number
  installments: number
}[]
```
